# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_sub$
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#

# For security we will only export to localhost (127.0.0.1) and use an ssh tunnel to reach ports on the server are expl
# We are explicitly defining the options
# rw - read and write, default is readonly (ro)
# sync - sychronize the files immediately - more stable if the server has a failure
# root_squash - prevents root user from accessing the share -- this is significant because a UID identifying as root (UID 0) on a client can access files as root on the server
